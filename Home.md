# Catherine Helenna Mulyadi

Hi everyone! Welcome to my portfolio page.

I am Catherine Helenna Mulyadi, a Master student majoring in Data Science from Nanyang Technological University, aiming to transition career from chemistry to data.
Throughout my undergraduate research experience, I found myself enjoying the process of preparing data from scratch and then presenting insights on public.
This excitement has sparked my interest in learning more about the advanced data tools and technologies so that I can eventually offer more to industries.

You can find my projects here and there'll be more to be posted so stay tuned!
